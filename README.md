# Team Page Generator

CLI that develops an HTML page containing info about your team (provided by the user.) This was a project for the UCONN Coding Bootcamp, and is not intended for commercial use. The original purpose of the project was to encourage us to learn about unit testing, which was done with the Jest framework. Admittedly, though, I ended up not using a lot of the methods I actually tested for, nor the templating solution that was initially recommended. The final project ended up far, far simpler than I think was actually intended, but it should nonetheless meet all of the requirements put forth in the assignment.

## Installation

After downloading the files, be sure to "npm install" for required packages (Inquirer, FS, and Jest)

## Usage

Run with "node teamgen.js" and follow the prompts that come up. Be sure to have the filepath "./myteam.html" open, as the program will overwrite whatever's there upon completion.
